# Move There

### An app to help you make a big life decision

-------------------------------------

## How it works
Register with your username, password and email. Answer a few simple questions of what you are looking for in a place to live. Then you can start entering in the address of houses you are looking at on the market. From there, the program does the rest. With your preferences and prospective properties, Move There will tell you what there is to like, and not like, about the new neighborhood.

Utilizing weather date from Open Weather Map, walk scores from WalkScore, demographic information from the government, Yelp information, and YouTube, Move There provides everything you need!

Address isn't what you thought it was? Edit any address you've entered.
No longer want to look at the location? Delete the address.

Interested in properties other users are looking at? Feel Free!
